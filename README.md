# Meme Trend Analysis System

A comprehensive system for analyzing meme propagation, toxicity, and engagement patterns across social media platforms. This project was developed in three phases at SUNY Binghamton, processing over 1M+ memes and 4,000+ daily comments from Reddit and 4chan.

## Project Structure
The project was developed in three sequential phases:

### Phase 1: Data Collection System
- Implemented continuous data collection from Reddit and 4chan
- Built scalable MongoDB storage architecture
- Developed rate-limiting and error handling mechanisms
- [View Details](./project1_data_collection)

### Phase 2: Analysis & Measurements
- Analyzed 1M+ memes across platforms
- Implemented toxicity detection using ModerateHatespeech API
- Processed 4,000+ comments daily
- Performed cross-platform comparative analysis
